<br><br><!--Spacing Break-->
            <p><span class="tab">My</span> names Jason and I am currently attending the Rutgers Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp.  I spent the majority of the last decade working in the Import/Export
                industry at docks in NJ and PA.  Meeting people from all across the world and working with people from all backgrounds was an enlightening experience.  I enjoy being in a constant
                state of learning and problem solving.  My attention is drawn to things that are dynamic and ever evolving.  I started teaching myself Python towards the end of 2021 and decided
                 that I needed to make a change in careers where I made coding my focus.  My goal is to work as hard as I can, graduate from the program, and find a job in web development.  Long term, I
                  would like to use the skills that I've gained from my time working in Import/Export with the skills I will gain in development to work my way up to being a Project Manager. <br><br>
                <span class="tab">In</span> my down time I enjoy anything in the Horror genre, watching movies, reading books, playing games, collecting, etc.  I have
                been learning how to play rhythm guitar for a long time.  My favorite guitars I own are all Wylde Audio.  My most prized guitar is the Nordic Ice Blood Eagle my
                fiance bought me.  I also really love Byzantine and Gothic architecture as well as going to art exhibits and museums.  My favorite American artist is Andrew Wyeth.
                Below I put a few links so you can take a look at some of them.
